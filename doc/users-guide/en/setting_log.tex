\section{Setting log file output and how to read log file} \label{sec:log}
%====================================================================================

% Ticket #920

\scalerm can output log files when you execute \verb|scale-rm|, \verb|scale-rm_init|, \verb|scale-rm_pp|. In a default setting, one log file for the process of number zero is outputed as "\verb|LOG.pe000000|" for \verb|scale-rm|, "\verb|init_LOG.pe000000|" for \verb|scale-rm_init|", and \verb|pp_LOG.pe000000|" for \verb|scale-rm_pp|. Users can modify the log file outputs by editing configuration files of \texttt{run.conf}, \texttt{init.conf}, and \texttt{pp.conf}} as follows:

\editboxtwo{
\verb|&PARAM_IO| & \\
\verb| IO_LOG_BASENAME = 'LOG-test1',| & ; output name of log files\\
\verb| IO_LOG_ALLNODE  = .true.,| & ; output log files for all processes or not?\\
\verb|/|\\
}

A name of log file is controled by \nmitem{IO_LOG_BASENAME} in \namelist{PARAM_IO}. In the above sample, log files will be outputted as "\verb|LOG-test1.pe000000|". \nmitem{IO_LOG_ALLNODE} in \namelist{PARAM_IO} controls to output log files for all processes or not. When \nmitem{IO_LOG_ALLNODE} is set as "\verb|.true.|", log files for all processes will be outputted. The default setting for this parameter is "\verb|.false.|".
An example of log output line is a follow when you execute \verb|scale-rm|:\\
\msgbox{
  *** TIME: 0000/01/01 00:06:36 + 0.600 STEP:   1984/ 432000 WCLOCK:    2000.2\\
}
From this line, you can recognize following condtions of the computation:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Now, carrying out 6m36.6s of time integration from the initial time of "0000/01/01 00:00:00 + 0.000".
 \item This is 1984 step in whole time steps of 432000.
 \item 2000.2s was taken in a wall clock time (cpu time) .
\end{itemize}
Furthermore, the elapsed time to the finish of this computation can be estimated from these infromation.
In this case, 440000s ( $= 2000.2 \times 432000 \div 1984$ ) is the estimated elapsed time.


% ----- Future Work ----------------------------------------------------------
% The description of signal code such as "***" for warning and "xxx" for error,
% is skipped in this time. Coz, the rule has not been defined regidly,
% and has not been applied to the source codes.
% When the policy is defined, add the descriptions about Ticket #1042.
