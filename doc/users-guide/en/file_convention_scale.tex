In this chapter,
the data file convention used in \scalelib is explained.
\scalelib employs the data format devloped by Unidata
(\url{http://www.unidata.ucar.edu}) and utilizes \netcdf to
treat the SCALE native file.
\netcdf file format is self-descriptive and
can store any information required for data
with axis information in the file itself.
Since the data file does not have much less dependecy such as bit endian,
it is available on many machine that installs \netcdf. 
Unpon this format, there is some  convention peculiar to \scalelib.
The SCALE native file is referred to as SCALE-IO file.

\section{Global Attributes} 
In SCALE-IO file,
the explanation of data itself and spatial mesh information
are store as Global Attribute.
