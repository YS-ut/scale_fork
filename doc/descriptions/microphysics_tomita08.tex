\subsection{Six-class Single-moment Bulk Scheme (Tomita 2008)}
ix-class single-moment bulk scheme in the SCALE was developed by \citet{tomita_2008}. This scheme predicts mass exchange among six categories of water substances (water vapor, cloud water, rain, cloud ice, snow, and graupel), which is largely based on the method of \citet{Lin_etal}. However, there are some modifications from the original method of \citet{Lin_etal}: Both cloud water and cloud ice are generated only by a saturation adjustment process, and wet growth process of graupel is omitted. According to \citet{tomita_2008}, these modifications result in 20\% reduction in computational cost compared to \citet{Lin_etal} without significant changes on physical performance.
