\subsection{Six-class Single-moment Bulk Scheme (Tomita 2008)}
ix-class single-moment bulk scheme in the SCALE was developed by \citet{tomita_2008}. This scheme predicts mass exchange among six categories of water substances (water vapor, cloud water, rain, cloud ice, snow, and graupel), which is largely based on the method of \citet{lin_etal_1983}. However, there are some modifications from the original method of \citet{lin_etal_1983}: Both cloud water and cloud ice are generated only by a saturation adjustment process, and wet growth process of graupel is omitted. According to \citet{tomita_2008}, these modifications result in 20\% reduction in computational cost compared to \citet{lin_etal_1983} without significant changes on physical performance.

\subsubsection{Optional schemes}
There are some optional schemes which can be applied to the six-class single-moment bulk microphysics. Cloud ice generation can be explicitly solved as the original method of \citet{lin_etal_1983} instead of the saturation adjustment process. Conversion terms of cloud water to rain ($P_{RAUT}$ and $P_{RACW}$) can be replaced with those used in \citet{khairoutdinov_and_kogan_2000}. Intercept parameters of particle size distribution ($N_{0R}$, $N_{0S}$, $N_{0G}$) can be diagnostically derived by the formulation of \citet{wainwright_etal_2014} instead of the constant values. Bimodal particle size distribution can be applied to snow following \citet{roh_and_satoh_2007} instead of Marshall-Palmer exponential size distribution.
